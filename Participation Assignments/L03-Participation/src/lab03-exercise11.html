  <h2> 1. Describe the difference between a relative and absolute reference. When should each be used?</h2>
  <h1>An absolute reference is used when referring to an external source and is used because you need to be very specific on where something is when working externally in order to make sure you are referencing the right thing.
  A relative reference is used when referring to something on the same server or in the same file structure and is less specific when pointing to whatever you are referring. This is because when working internally you don't need to worry as much about tracking things down in other locations. </h1>

  <h2> 2. Why is removing presentation-oriented markup from oneâ€™s HTML documents considered to be best practice?  Where is the proper place to locate presentation formatting?</h2>
  <h1>It is better to use CSS as it gives you more options and also keeps your HTML documents focused on the formatting and text and allows you to create style sheets in CSS for presentation based stuff.</h1>

  <h2> 3. How does the figure element differ from the img element? In what situations does it make sense to use or not use figure?</h2>
  <h1>the img tag only refers to images while the figure tag can be used for any type of essential content that could be moved to a different location in the page or document, and won't change the meaning of the document</h1>
